== 0.2.0 2012-05-14

 * Works with Ruby 1.8.6, 1.8.7, 1.9.2, 1.9.3.
 * MIT License.
 * Friendlier changelog.
 * Added C::Preprocessor, which wraps Config::CONFIG['CPP']. Assumes
   POSIX-style -D and -I options.
 * IntLiteral suffixes are parsed correctly for things like 2e-2.
 * Newlines are allowed in StringLiterals and CharLiterals.
 * Added StringLiteral and CharLiteral #prefix. #wide? and #wide are
   now methods, not fields.
 * IntLiteral and FloatLiteral #format is now the first field.
 * More meaningful parse error messages.
 * Printing (#to_s):
   * FunctionDef#no_prototype? is now honored.
   * ':' is now printed for labels.
   * Consequetive unary operators no longer conflict with other
     operators (e.g. "+ +" instead of "++").
   * Sizeof is printed with parentheses (not mandated by C99, but
     conventional).
   * Signedness qualifier is always printed for char.
   * Longness is printed correctly for Bool, Complex, Imaginary.
   * Nested Conditionals are handled correctly.
   * MemberInit#member is printed correctly.
 * Parsing (#parse):
   * Member now works.
   * Expression now supports CompoundLiterals without types (as
     allowed in declarators only).
   * Declarator allows specification of #num_bits.
